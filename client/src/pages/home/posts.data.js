    post_content: 'Please remember to submit your required medical vaccine documentation.\nAs the University communicated in early May, Wentworth is requiring all students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to protect the health and safety of the entire University and the community that surrounds our campus. We know that the vaccinations are effective and the best way for us to ensure an engaging in-person experience for our students during the 2021-22 academic year.\nTo support a seamless vaccine compliance process for our students, Wentworth has engaged CastleBranch, an independent compliance company working with many colleges and universities, to provide a HIPPA-compliant, vaccine portal. This new portal will allow our students to upload all their medical vaccine documentation and to access their medical vaccine records in the future.',
